# 🌱 VibeRoot: Your Plant Soulmate

> **"Tinder for Plants" — Powered by Google Gemini**

VibeRoot isn't a boring plant encyclopedia. It is a mood-based recommendation engine that finds the perfect plant for your specific personality and lifestyle.

## The Problem
People kill plants because they buy based on looks, not compatibility. Beginners don't know horticulture terms, but they know how they *feel* (stressed, busy, energetic).

## The Solution
VibeRoot takes your abstract "Vibe" (e.g., *"I feel chaotic but want to grow"*) and uses AI to translate that into a concrete biological match.

## How It Works
1.  **Input:** You type your current mood or lifestyle vibe.
2.  **AI Analysis:** Google Gemini analyzes the psychology of your input.
3.  **The Match:** The app suggests the biologically perfect plant "Soulmate."
4.  **Cloud Save:** Saves your match to the "My Garden" cloud database (Firestore).
